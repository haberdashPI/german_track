Title: Adapting attention in a dynamic three-speaker auditory scene

**Background**: In our every-day life we are able to focus on what matters to us in dynamic, and complex auditory environments. How do we maintain attention and track the ongoing changes to sound sources? Past work examining scene analysis of continuous speech has focused on cases where the location of the speakers remains static or---in one case---includes discontinuous switches in location. Here we employed a challenging multi-speaker stimulus containing three sources and ongoing, continuous changes to the spatial location of those sources.

**Methods**: Using simulated cocktail party stimuli across speakers and spatial locations, we explore listeners' ability to flag targets embedded in these stimuli while varying attentional foci. Listeners were presented with the same set of stimuli under a number of different listening conditions: some that required more selective listening while other conditions engaged broadly-tuned listening strategies.

***Results**: By a variety of measures, spatial switches that occurred later in a trial were less disruptive to attention. The salience of targets had a greater impact on performance when listeners were required to attend to the entire auditory scene, rather than more selectively.

**Conclusion**: Overall the results are consistent with the hypothesis that selective attention is partly comprised of a rapid learning process that adjusts the components of perception to the task and the dynamics of the current environment.
