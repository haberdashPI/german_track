    select_windows(conditions, subjects)

Select windows of eeg data defined by a bounding function.

## Arugments

- conditions: a dictionary where each key is a named tuple describing the
specific condition windows will be associated with and each entry is a
function. When applied to the rows of the event data this function will
return the range of times in seconds (as a tuple) to be included or
no_indices (if no data applies for the given case)

- subjects: a dictionary containing the file => data pairs, each data entry
should contain a named tuple of eeg (for EEGData), event (for data frame of
events) and sid (a String) entries.
