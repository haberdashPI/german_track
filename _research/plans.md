# Plans

- filter data using 
  - alpha for spatial?
        - in Frey et al 2014 (J Neuro), they find the band to be around 8-16 Hz (looked at synchronization (e.g. phase coherence))
        - in Müller and Weisz 2012 (C Cortex) in the range of 5-15, and further filtered to 9 ± 3 (looked at power)
        - in region of 11 ± 3 with filtering (from a window of 6 - 15 Hz)

  - gamma for others?
        - 30-50 Hz
        - (we need more specific measures here, can't really get an envelope following response here)

- do we compare across conditions (with same stimulus and subject)
    - in online decoding, does the increase look different?
    - does the target event get detected better across conditions?
- static windows around locations of interest
- stimulus encoding: consider multiple frequency bands
- include surprisal (e.g. pitch derivative) for target
