## plans

remaining tasks:

1. merve's individual data for build-up angles
2. see if new cross-validation approach helps with fig 4/5
3. determining if decoding can be improved through some of the obvious steps I'm working on
  a. improving model features (with new Flux implementation)
    i. related note: with flux, improving loss function (avoid decoding non-target)???
  b. changing criterion (mixutre of sources)

codecleanup:

figure nitpicks:
- set scales (0.5 - 1 mostly)
- change y axis labels for neuarl data near/far
- use more horizontal space
- focus on angle for the buildup curve (don't need hit rate)
- include angle in fig 4 (fig 3 data)
- maybe a difference between neuarl

- feature plots for fig2 & 3?

# cleanup

- rename ishit

## 1. Main result: the different conditions have different brain responses

- [X] power analysis
- [X] subpanel broken down by different response types
- [X] establish a baseline: null model? shuffled labels? hit type?
    - [X] random pre-target window
    - [X] random post-target window
    - [X] shuffled labels: better than random chance (yes)
    - [X] null model: do features matter (yes)
    - [X] random window: does window timing matter (no)
    - [X] random trial type: does the response type matter (yes)
- [X] regression components
- [X] subset of channels
- [x] plot of main result and selected baseline !! (can occur indepndent of behavioral data)
    - [X] recent changes introduced a bug; all labels are 'object' (did we loose the others, or did they change to 'object'?)
    - [x] add baseline to main bar plot
- [x] get human data !!
    - [X] store and load raw event files
    - [x] find stimulus metadata (timings of targets; stored in .mat file)
    - [x] store metadata in portable format, and load the data
- [ ] stats
- [ ] try MCCA averaging???
