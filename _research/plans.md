# Plans

- filter data using 
  - alpha for spatial?
  - gamma for others?
- static windows around locations of interest
- stimulus encoding: consider multiple frequency bands
- include surprisal (e.g. pitch derivative) for target
- do we compare across conditions (with same stimulus and subject)
    - in online decoding, does the increase look different?
    - does the target event get detected better across conditions?
