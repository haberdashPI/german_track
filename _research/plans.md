- decoding: look atmiss-miss
- look at target classification vs. pre-target window region, compare cacross codnitions,
use a baseline with two random windows before the target

presentation (for lab meeting tuesday)

what do we show:
abstract references early late
- maybe salience early/late?
- or merve's original figure for hit rate

## plans

- build-up angles: careful look at merve's data
- early/late salience (but classifier trained across both cases)
- decoding: try ann again (without L1 optimizer)

remaining tasks:

1. merve's individual data for build-up angles
- still questions: data not quite the same
- intercept for logistic regression has a confusing value (why is it negative??)

codecleanup:

figure nitpicks:
- set scales (0.5 - 1 mostly)
- change y axis labels for neuarl data near/far
- use more horizontal space
- focus on angle for the buildup curve (don't need hit rate)
- include engle in fig 4 (fig 3 data)
- maybe a difference between neuarl

- feature plots for fig2 & 3?

# cleanup

- rename ishit

## 1. Main result: the different conditions have different brain responses

- [X] power analysis
- [X] subpanel broken down by different response types
- [X] establish a baseline: null model? shuffled labels? hit type?
    - [X] random pre-target window
    - [X] random post-target window
    - [X] shuffled labels: better than random chance (yes)
    - [X] null model: do features matter (yes)
    - [X] random window: does window timing matter (no)
    - [X] random trial type: does the response type matter (yes)
- [X] regression components
- [X] subset of channels
- [x] plot of main result and selected baseline !! (can occur indepndent of behavioral data)
    - [X] recent changes introduced a bug; all labels are 'object' (did we loose the others, or did they change to 'object'?)
    - [x] add baseline to main bar plot
- [x] get human data !!
    - [X] store and load raw event files
    - [x] find stimulus metadata (timings of targets; stored in .mat file)
    - [x] store metadata in portable format, and load the data
- [ ] stats
- [ ] try MCCA averaging???
