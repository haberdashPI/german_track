how do we avoid the strawman argument that the cases are different: there are lots of reasons they could be different.

more to the point, what we need is a comparison of *types* of differences:
if the differences is about how attention is configured how will that manifest in ways that simply having a different "listening-plan" would manifest.

on the adaptation of detection point, in decoding we should be able to see that over time: if it's about adapating to the target of interest we should see the conditions looking more and more different from one another over time.

We could see a different time course over which the distinctions across conditions arise.

action items:
- look at time course of decoding
- look at time course of condition-hit classification
