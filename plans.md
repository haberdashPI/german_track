## Current steps

Working on a sanity check: when listeners are instructed to attend to the male speaker
(the 'object' condition) we should be able to decode this speaker.

This didn't seem to work, and it appears that's because the wrong audio
files are specified in the experiment_record.mat. I'm probably going
to have to reconstruct the stimulus files, and collect some new data.
