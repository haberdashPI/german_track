# Plans

## Current anlaysis steps

Try cleaning up the data more
Add sid 14
Improve analysis scripts (make more general) ??
Try training switches on everything, not just the correct trials


## Current experiment steps

fix Presentation triggers (seems to be using older bit signals...?)
organize consent form

## Notes

[This article](https://doi.org/10.1101/530220) suggests now high-pass
filtering should be used, and any de-trending should involve some sort of
more robust method.
