- due to error when switching screen, program crashed after first block of final condition. I paused because I was worried about the amount of noise
in the readings.

- restarted experiment after instructions to increase volume
- during global condition, finds it easier to notice changes in female voice vs. male voice

0003 - 

- electrode B26 is probably bad
- found feature condition easier
