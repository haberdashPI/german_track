- establish: why is it so different

look at things per trial Q: why so different from traditional decoding

- can we see better before target decoding accuracy
- during switch (i.e. are switches messing up tracking, so we'd see better tracking pre-target for regions far from switches, or near late switches)

or reverse engineer:
- what condition give before target decoding accuracy that's better
take all decoding

2:

then some hoping check

for fig2:
show d' figure
show fp broken down as a separate figure

for fig4:
maybe show hit rate by target time
maybe show some switches along the course of the target time


alpha oscillation - look at alpha power or gamma power or global or object
    - time lock to target time
