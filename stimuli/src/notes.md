# Notes

First point: we need to create the same set of text files, because that is
what Presentation uses (not worth using a different format). This will give
us the right responses and the right timings for the feedback guide.

Second point: if the train_messages text exists somewhere in the MATLAB code,
I dont' know where it is, I need to re-create it with the same format.

The files I need are:

* train_messages.txt (this is the one I have to recreate, based on the example)
* target_info_all.txt
* target_info_obj.txt
* target_info_dir.txt
